## Testing Standards

All code contributions should include appropriate tests. We use pytest for testing our Python code.

```python
def test_agent_creation():
    agent = Agent()
    assert agent is not None
```

Make sure to run the test suite before submitting your PR:

```bash
pytest
```

## Code Style

We follow PEP 8 for Python code style. Please ensure your code is properly formatted before submitting a pull request.
