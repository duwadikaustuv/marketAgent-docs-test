# Advanced Features

MarketAgents includes several advanced features for power users who need more control over their agent-based systems.

## Custom Rate Limits

Control the rate at which your agents can make requests to external APIs to prevent rate limiting and manage costs:

```python
from market_agents import RequestLimits

limits = RequestLimits(
    max_requests=500,
    per_minute=60
)

# Apply the limits to your agent
agent = Agent(request_limits=limits)
```

## Pydantic Integration

MarketAgents leverages Pydantic for type-safe data validation. Define structured outputs for your agents to ensure they return data in the expected format:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class TradeDecision(BaseModel):
    action: str  # "buy" or "sell"
    quantity: int
    price: float

# Use the model with your agent
result = agent.run(
    prompt="Analyze the market and make a trade decision",
    output_schema=TradeDecision
)

# Access the structured data
print(f"Action: {result.action}")
print(f"Quantity: {result.quantity}")
print(f"Price: ${result.price}")
```

## Parallel Processing

Execute multiple agent tasks concurrently to improve performance:

```python
from market_agents import parallel_run

results = parallel_run([
    agent1.analyze_task("Market sentiment analysis"),
    agent2.analyze_task("Technical indicator check"),
    agent3.analyze_task("News sentiment analysis")
])
```
